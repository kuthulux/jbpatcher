1. Install Eclipse
2. Import the existing project into Eclipse
3. Modify build.properties. You will need to adapt the paths for the Java 1.4 SDK,
   and for *all* supported firmware libraries. You'll need to extract the libraries
   from a Kindle device running the respective version (or from an image or update
   file). It's enough to copy *all* .jar files found in the /opt/amazon/ebook/lib
   directory, and its subdirectories.
4. Run the "dist-all" target of build.xml to compile and prepare for packaging.
5. To generate the update packages, run dist.sh in the dist directory (requires
   a compatible kindletool, and Linux or cygwin).
   
Good luck!

PS: Don't worry if part of the project's sources is displayed as "broken" in Eclipse.
    That's because different classes use different versions of the libraries, so it's
    generally not possible to satisfy all dependencies at the same time.
    The build.xml works around this by compiling in multiple stages, using the
    correct required libraries at each stage.
