# This is the configuration file for jbpatcher.
# It lists all the patches that are enabled on your Kindle.
# Empty lines, or lines starting with a "#", such as this one,
# are ignored. All other lines are interpreted as filenames of
# patches to apply, but there are a few rules, which are explained
# below:
#
# 1. Patches are considered in the order they appear in this file.
#    Patches may be able to handle multiple versions of their "target"
#    files (for instance for different firmware revisions). Similarly,
#    they might be able to patch files that have previously been altered
#    by other patches, or they might even depend on such modifications.
#    This is the reason why ordering is (or at least, might be) important.
#
# 2. Patches MUST be in the same directory as this file, their extension
#    MUST be .jbpatch, and their filename MUST NOT contain characters other
#    than A-Z,a-z,0-9, and any of the following 4 characters: .-_@
#
# 3. You can rename patches (as long as you obey the above rules) at will.

# This sample patch (provided with the distribution) replaces the "Legal"
# information from the settings menu. It is not enabled by default, because
# it might be confusing for some people. To enable it, just uncomment it
# (i.e., remove the leading "#").
#ixtab_legal-5.1.0.jbpatch

# Another sample patch provided with the distribution. This one allows you
# to turn on Text-to-Speech unconditionally (i.e., not restricted by vendor
# flags, or if the book language is different from english.
