# This file lets you redefine the margins that are applied when
# the Kindle displays content. Before changing any setting, please
# make sure that you have read ALL of the documentation available
# in this file.

# DO NOT REMOVE THE NEXT LINE ("[en]"), IT IS IMPORTANT !!!

# The following setting applies to the "normal" reader, and controls the left/right
# margins in pixels for the words per line (fewest, fewer, default), in this
# order. The line should consist of three positive integers, separated by a space.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# Because these preferences are cached by the Kindle, the effect of changing the
# value here may not have an immediately noticeable effect. If you are stuck with
# the old settings after changing the values here, try changing the setting to a
# different value (e.g. "fewest"), then back to the intended setting.
#
# The Kindle's default behavior is:
# font.wordsperline.margin.list=120 80 40

font.wordsperline.margin.list=120 80 40



# Left/right margins. 
# These values are overridden in by the "font.wordsperline.margin.list"
# setting in the "normal" ebook reader, but they are important for the
# PDF reader.
#
# The Kindle's default behavior is:
# reader.content.leftMargin=40
# reader.content.rightMargin=40

reader.content.leftMargin=40
reader.content.rightMargin=40



# This value determines the height of the footer (displaying the current location,
# percentage, etc.), and is *subtracted* from reader.content.bottomMargin (see
# below). You can completely hide the footer by setting this value to 0.
#
# The Kindle's default behavior is:
# reader.progressbar.footer.height=30

reader.progressbar.footer.height=30



# To change the bottom margin, modify the following value.
# WARNING: this value should not be less than the value
# of reader.progressbar.footer.height (see above).
# If you set a wrong value here, you are on your own.

# The Kindle's default behavior is:
# reader.content.bottomMargin=30

reader.content.bottomMargin=30



# To change the top margin, modify the following value.
# WARNING: this value should not be less than the value
# of reader.content.topMarginOffset (see below).
# If you set a wrong value here, you are on your own.
#
# The Kindle's default behavior is:
# reader.content.topMargin=30

reader.content.topMargin=30



# This value is *subtracted* from reader.content.topMargin (see above)
# when a book is opened. Presumably, it accounts for the height of the
# title bar (which is hidden afterwards).
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
#
# The Kindle's default behavior is:
# reader.content.topMarginOffset=10

reader.content.topMarginOffset=10
