#
# This is the configuration file for jbpatch (v1.2.0)
#
# It lists all the patches that are enabled on your Kindle.
# Empty lines, or lines starting with a "#", such as this one,
# are ignored. All other lines are interpreted as filenames of
# patches to apply, but there are a few rules, which are explained
# below:
#
# 1. Patches are considered in the order they appear in this file.
#    Patches may be able to handle multiple versions of their "target"
#    files (for instance for different firmware revisions). Similarly,
#    they might be able to patch files that have previously been altered
#    by other patches, or they might even depend on such modifications.
#    This is the reason why ordering is (or at least, might be) important.
#
# 2. Patches MUST be in the same directory as this file, their extension
#    MUST be either .jbpatch or .zip, and their filename MUST NOT contain
#    characters other than A-Z,a-z,0-9, and any of the following 4: .-_@
#
# 3. You can rename patches (as long as you obey the above rules) at will.

# Enable Text-to-Speech unconditionally (i.e., not restricted by
# vendor flags, or if the book language is different from english)
# You can also change the description of the voices, by modifying the
# file "ttspatch.txt" INSIDE that zip file.

# Increase the width of scrollbars so that there actually is a chance to
# use them with a finger. In addition, enable scroll bar functionality
# for long menus.
ixtab_scrollbar-5.1.0.jbpatch

# Enable all rotations across the Java UI. To take full
# advantage of this, you'll probably want to install the Launcher
# extension, which allows you to actually select the rotation.
# It is strongly recommended to have the scrollbar patch active as well,
# because otherwise you may not be able to make full use of the menus
# in landscape mode.
ixtab_rotation-5.1.0.jbpatch

# This sample patch replaces the "Legal" information
# from the settings menu. It is not enabled by default, because
# it is really only a demo, and it might be confusing for some people.
# To enable this patch, just uncomment it (i.e., remove the leading "#").
#ixtab_legal-5.1.0.jbpatch
