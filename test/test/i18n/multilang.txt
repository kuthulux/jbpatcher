# The idea here is:
# fr_FR is fully present => fr_FR
# de_DE is present "indirectly" (de) only => de
# it_IT is not present at all => en

  # There is also weird spacing all over this file. This
        # is intended.

[a section]
lang=a section

[fr_FR]
 lang    =    fr_FR

[en]
#this is actually the fallback
 lang=en

[de]
lang=de

[fr]
lang=fr
